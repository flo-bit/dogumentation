# Quick Start

Quick start guide using github pages.

## Fork the repo

Fork the repo, naming it depending on where you want to it to show up.

If you want to host it on `yourusername.github.io` then name the repo `yourusername.github.io`.

Otherwise, name it something like `my-docs` and it will be hosted at `yourusername.github.io/my-docs`.

Go to `/src/config.ts` and change the `SITE` and `BASE` variables.

- `SITE` should be be `https://yourusername.github.io`.

- `BASE` should either be empty if you named the repo `yourusername.github.io` or the name of the repo 
if you named it something else with a leading `/` (e.g. `/my-docs`).

## Enable github pages

Enable github pages in the repo settings. Go to *SETTINGS &rarr; PAGES &rarr; SOURCE: Github Actions*

Your site should be live after a few minutes.

## Development preview

1. Clone repo locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open the development preview at `http://localhost:4321/BASE`

Changes made to the docs will be reflected live.

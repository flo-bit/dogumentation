# Configuration

There are some configuration options that can be set in the `src/config.ts` file.

Most importantly you **have** to set the `SITE` and `BASE` variables for deployment 
(see [Quick Start](/dogumentation/docs/quick-start) for more information).

## Basics

Set your site name, description and favicon.

```ts
const config = {
  //...

  SITE_NAME: "Dogumentation",
	SITE_DESCRIPTION: "Simple, minimalistic documentation template using astro",
  SITE_FAVICON: "üê∂"

  // ...
}
```

## Colors

Set the base and accent colors for your site.

Base colors can be `zinc`, `slate`, `neutral`, `stone`, `gray`.

Accent colors can be `red`, `orange`, `amber`, `yellow`, `lime`, `green`, `emerald`, `teal`, `cyan`, `sky`, `blue`, `indigo`, `violet`, `purple`, `fuchsia`, `pink`, `rose`.

```ts
const config = {
  //...

  BASE_COLOR: "zinc",
  ACCENT_COLOR: "cyan"

  // ...
}
```

## Social Links

Set the social links for your site.

```ts
const config = {
  //...

  SOCIAL_LINKS: {
    FACEBOOK_URL: "https://facebook.com/your-page",
    TWITTER_URL: "https://twitter.com/your-page",
    GITHUB_URL: "https://github.com/your-page",
    LINKEDIN_URL: "https://linkedin.com/in/your-page",
    YOUTUBE_URL: "https://youtube.com/your-page",
    BLUESKY_URL: "https://bluesky.com/your-page",
    DISCORD_URL: "https://discord.com/your-page",
    EMAIL: "your-email@example.com"
  }
}
```

Any of the links can be omitted if you don't have a page for that social link.

All included social links will be shown in the header and footer of your site like this:

import SocialIcons from "$components/SocialIcons.astro";

<div class="flex items-center justify-end gap-x-4 p-4 bg-base-100 dark:bg-base-900/50 border border-base-200 dark:border-base-800 rounded-2xl">
  <SocialIcons />
</div>

## Start page

The start page will show a button to the first doc in your `src/content/docs` folder (= the first one in the sidebar).

It will also show your site name and description and a screenshot of your app.

Set the screenshot by replacing `src/assets/screen-light.png` and `src/assets/screen-dark.png` with your own images.

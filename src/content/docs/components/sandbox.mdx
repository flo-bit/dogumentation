# Interactive Sandbox

You can show interactive code examples in your documentation with the sandbox component.


```astro
import Sandbox from "$components/sandbox/";

<Sandbox folder="example1" active="Counter.js" />
```


import Sandbox from "$components/sandbox/";

<Sandbox folder="example1" active="Counter.js" />

Your folder **must** be in the `src/examples` folder.

The `active` file is the file that will be shown when the sandbox is opened.

Sandboxes include tailwind and the previews background and text color is set to match the rest of your site 
(both in dark and light mode). If you add your own styles, be careful to always include a dark and 
light mode version of your styles by using the `dark:` prefix.

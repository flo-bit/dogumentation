# Embeds

You can show youtube videos, link cards, excalidraw diagrams and github repos in your documentation.

## Youtube

Simply write a youtube url in your markdown like this (with nothing else on the same line):

```mdx
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

### Result:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

## Link Card

Add any other url for a link card like this (again with nothing else on the same line):

```mdx
https://flo-bit.dev
```

### Result:

https://flo-bit.dev

## Excalidraw

You can also show excalidraw diagrams, that will be rendered in the correct dark/light mode like this
(they **must** be in the `src/assets` folder):

```mdx
:excalidraw[$assets/excalidraw-demo.svg]
```

### Result:

:excalidraw[$assets/excalidraw-demo.svg]

## Github

You can show a github repo card by just writing the url like this (again with nothing else on the same line):

```mdx
https://github.com/flo-bit/svelte-openai-realtime-api
```

### Result:

https://github.com/flo-bit/svelte-openai-realtime-api

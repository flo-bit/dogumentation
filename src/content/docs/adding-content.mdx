# Adding content

Simply add markdown files ending with `.mdx` to the `/src/content/docs` folder to add content to your docs.

## Frontmatter

All `.mdx` files support frontmatter and **must** have the following two properties:

```mdx
---
title: "My Doc"
description: "This is a doc"
---
```

## Order

Docs are ordered alphabetically by default. 
You can change the order by setting the `order` property to a number in the frontmatter.
Files with a lower number will be shown first. All files with any order tag will be shown before the files without.

```mdx
---
order: 1
---
```

## Categories

You can add a category to a doc by setting the `category` property in the frontmatter.

```mdx
---
category: "My Category"
---
```

Categories are used to group docs together in the sidebar.
They are also sorted alphabetically by default. 
You can also set a `categoryOrder` property to at least one file in that category to sort the categories.

```mdx
---
categoryOrder: 1
---
```

Again categories with a lower number will be shown first and categories without any category order set will be shown last.

Files without a category will be always be shown first.

You can also put your files in subfolders, these are just for organization and will not affect the order of the docs.

## Links

All relative links should start with `/BASE/docs/` 
(with the same `BASE` as the one set in `src/config.ts`).

For example if you want to link to `/src/content/docs/quick-start.mdx`
you should use the following link:

```mdx
[Quick Start](/YOUR-BASE/docs/quick-start)
```
